# Cellar Beer

[Version fran√ßaise](./README_fr.md)

Cellar Beer is a mobile liquor cellar application.
The aim is to provide people who like to taste good alcohol with the possibility of saving their favorite drinks.

## Context

Having several friends who enjoy tasting beers, many have difficulty finding the name of the alcohol in question during certain events.
It could be beers for each other's parties.
Special wines for Sunday barbecues.
Exceptional spirits that have made a lasting impression on you.

That's how I came up with `Cellar Beer`!!!
A `Free`, `open source`, `Simple`, `No data collection` mobile application.

## Features

In `Cellar Beer` you have features right now, and more to come.

At present, you can:

* Add a drink with details and a photo
* Delete a spirit
* Modify a drink
* Bookmark a drink to find it faster
* Search for an alcohol on all its properties from the list

I hope to be able to deliver the following in the next few weeks:

* The `tags` for the alcohols that you'll be able to use to set keywords so that you can also search on these keywords
* Sharing a drink to a contact by SMS or email.

## A participatory application

Cellar Beer" is an application that I want to be participatory.
This means that anyone can make suggestions to improve it.
You'll notice that the application code is open. You can download it on your own for your needs without asking me.
But I'd really like the application to be of use to people other than my own circle of friends. Hence the community aspect to improve it.
Before you ask, `Cellar Beer` is free, Open Source.

I encourage you to participate, if only to make suggestions. You can do so from the link below
